       <h3>Cruel Summer</h3>
       <p>The song cruel summer reminded me of those times when you didn't yet confess your feelings to me. The line "Fever dream high in the quiet of the night" so fever dream means nightmare and i actually relate it to me, why? because love, i'm your greatest nightmare that time, i gave you mixed signals, gave you hoped that i like you but in reality i don't, i gave you my shirt just so you would get confused if i like you or not. “You Know What I Caught” You knew that i caught your heart, you knew that you cannot escape from me, you knew it would be hard for you to move on from me, You knew what i caught. At first, that's what I thought, But no. It was you who caught me, it was you who captured me, my attention, my whole being, my thoughts, my mind, it was you. It was you the whole time. “Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes ”I like this line a lot, because I'm the devil that rolled the dice, you’re the angel that rolled their eyes on my lies, when I lied in my replies. For me cruel summer described our situation when I haven't yet confessed my attraction to you, and to my satisfaction when our interaction widened because of my actions when I confessed my attraction.

       <h3>Cruel Summer</h3>
       <p>The song “Lover” holds a very special place in my heart. Every line in the song reminded me of you. The line “This is our place, we make the rules” This reminded me of our dreams to have a house together, to live together with our cat, a life with you. A life with you that is so sweet to imagine, it tastes like heaven. “Have i known you for twenty seconds or twenty years” Sometimes i feel like i've known you for a long time, and sometimes i feel like i've known you for 2 seconds, because there are some things that i discovered, something new, new information about you. “Can I go where you go” I don't wanna go if you aren't there, I don't wanna go to a place where there is no “You”. So, please take me wherever you go, I always wanna go where you go. In times when we are so close, so happy, and don't care about the world all I can say is “Can we always be this close”. The bridge “Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? With every guitar string scar on my hand I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue All's well that ends well to end up with you Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover” I want to shout to everyone that you are my lover, i want everyone to know that you are my woman, I want to end up with you, i want to be the one who whisper dirty jokes to your ears, i want to be your endgame.
